This is a way to cheat at the License Plate Game, savior of many a long car ride.  The rules are simple: try to make a word out of any passing license plate (it works best with plates that have three letters), keeping the order of the letters.  For example, 'DFF' could become 'daffodil', 'difficult', or 'dandruff'.  

I used the '5desk.txt' list of words from the official 12dicts package (v. 5.0), which can be found at http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/.

This was one of my very first projects; it taught me a lot about string manipulation, working with files, and general loop strategies.
